(Data Stream Clustering for Real Time Data Analysis under Dr. Ye Zhu)

- Reproduced and validated the MemStream algorithm for streaming-data anomaly detection through comprehensive literature review.
- Benchmarked MemStream’s performance against nine established algorithms over seven public datasets, using ROC-AUC and ROC-PR metrics to assess its relative effectiveness, supported by false positives and false negatives statistics.
- Authored a detailed report on the performance of the algorithm, along with comparative studies, highlighting the strengths and potential applications in streaming data environments.
